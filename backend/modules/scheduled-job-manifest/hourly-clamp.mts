 * minute :00 UTC, so all jobs share one wake per hour instead of each keeping its own minute.
 *
 * A glide-mq `every` schedule keeps the phase of its first upsert, so unaligned `every` jobs drift
 * onto different minutes, and a single-minute cron such as `17 * * * *` pins its own minute. Both
 * are rewritten to a cron pattern whose minute field is `0`.

 * Aligns a resolved (non-thunk) repeat to the hourly wake. A cron pattern whose minute field is
 * already `0` is returned unchanged (same reference), so callers can cheaply detect a rewrite via
 * the `clamped` flag.
 *
 * - `every` at or below one hour becomes `0 * * * *`.
 * - `every` above one hour rounds up to the next cadence that stays at :00 and does not fire more
 *   often than declared: the smallest of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 hours that is at least the
 *   declared interval (an hour-step cron: minute 0 of every Nth hour; `0 0 * * *` for 24 hours),
 *   then weekly (`0 0 * * 0`) up to 7 days, then monthly (`0 0 1 * *`). Monthly is the least
 *   frequent rung, so an interval longer than a month is capped there; no manifest job has one.
 * - A cron pattern keeps its hour, day-of-month, month and day-of-week fields and has its minute
 *   field replaced with `0`, so it never fires more than once in an hour it runs.
