// beforeEach/afterEach pair looks identical to a stray call at the AST level.

// Kept dependency-free (no import from 'vitest' at module scope) so the check function is
// unit-testable with a fake vi-shaped object, mirroring vitest-fork-leak-detection.mts.

// `.ts`, not `.mts`: the root-level setupFiles chain imports this inside the
// web-storybook-browser project, whose SWC transform hardcodes TypeScript detection to
// `.ts`/`.tsx` and silently misparses `.mts` as plain JS.
